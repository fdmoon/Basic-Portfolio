			<p>
				I'm a control systems engineer and getting ready to be a web developer in manufacturing, IT, energy &amp; utility, and software development industries. <br>
				I worked as a control systems engineer for Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. At the time, I participated in developing a ship automation system named ACONIS, and more of my work skills were on topics from implementation of multi-threaded applications in C/C++ and PLC programming for process control. In addition, Iâ€™ve been interested in the combination of legacy industrial control systems and IT technologies including Big Data, Cloud and IoT since I joined a smart ship project in order to provide total ship service solutions.
